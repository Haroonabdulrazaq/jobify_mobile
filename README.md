# Jobify Mobile

A job board which highlights jobs from other job boards. It shows the popular jobs, Jobs Nearby, and details of this jobs. It also include search functionality.

This is an introductory tutorial on how to build mobile applications using react-native.

I use api by rapidApi-JSearch [see details]('https://rapidapi.com/letscrape-6bRBa3QguO5/api/jsearch')

Use [`expo-router`](https://expo.github.io/router) to build native navigation using files in the `app/` directory.

I followed a tutorial by Adrian of JSMastery
[Youtube Channel]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ3bGvy0WAY&t=5459s')
